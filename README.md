# MeloChords-Generator

**MeloChords-Generator** is an innovative tool designed to facilitate music creation through the integration of advanced language models (LLMs) and MIDI generation. The project provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows both beginners and experienced musicians to generate melodies and chord progressions in MIDI format.  

## Description

MeloChords-Generator enables users to:  
- Create textual prompts and send them to a language model (LLM) to generate musical ideas;   
- Automatically generate MIDI melodies or chord progressions;  
- Visualize, listen to, and download the generated musical content directly from the interface.  

The project aims to achieve two main objectives:  
1. Make music creation more accessible to users with limited knowledge of music theory;  
2. Support music producers during creative blocks by providing inspiration and immediately usable material.
